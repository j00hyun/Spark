But I’d make a distinction between complex features and complex code; I don’t see any particular reason that Kotlin *must* have more complex features than Scala. Java certainly doesn’t. The price may be paid in terms of the quality of written code — good Java code makes my eyes glaze over in ways that good Scala code doesn’t — but I think it’s far from a given that Kotlin’s features will be as difficult for newcomers as Scala’s can be. They certainly seem a bit simpler overall.\n\n(I'm still wrapping my head around some stuff, although I’m a comparative newcomer.)\n\n&gt; I don't think Kotlin/Gosu/Ceylon will ever catch up to Scala in terms of stability, maturity, sophistication, tooling and third-pert library support, but only time will tell …\n\nI’d agree with all of that except tooling and library support.

{"archived":true,"author":"gfixler","body":"It's honestly phenomenally strange to have gone from a child of the late 70s/early 80s to today. I had all of these preconceived notions. I thought/hoped/dreamed we have communication devices one day, but I imagined it all wrong. I didn't think we'd have 18,000 different phones, and 6-month or less turnover times between new versions. I didn't understand 'markets.' I thought we'd all have \"the phone,\" like everyone on Star Trek had \"the communicator.\" I didn't know *everyone* would want to keep in constant touch with each other. I didn't realize that lurked in the hearts of the populace, especially in kids. I hated talking on the phone as a kid, as did many of my friends. It was what girls did, not guys. We didn't want to say things to each other. We wanted to play sports or video games, or sport-based video games. Calling was just to arrange times to do these things. I didn't understand that there could be a time - besides a roadside emergency - that you'd really ever want to call anyone while out and about, because my entire life had conditioned me to simply call ahead, make a quick plan, then stick to it.\n\nThen after college, still resisting the cell phones my friends had mostly all had for a few years, I found myself entering a theme park with said friends only to have them all head in different directions immediately. I yelled \"Wait! Wait a minute.\" They all stopped, confused. \"What's the plan? Where are we meeting later? Who's going where?\" All the answers ranged from shrugs to \"I don't know. We'll figure that out later.\" I still didn't know what was going on, then it dawned on me. They'd just call each other later to meet up.\n\nIt was the most bizarre experience, like my friends had all been replaced by something different. I hadn't even realized the world had changed, and the complete lack of discussion when we got there as everyone seemingly instinctively fanned out from the gates in different directions told me that it had changed a while ago. My life flashed before my eyes a bit, thinking about my own methods for staying in touch with friends and communicating with them.\n\nIt started to occur to me that I didn't understand the world now, and it was only going to get worse. Facebook, which I also waited years to sign up for, asked me all the time for captcha confirmation, stating that I could turn that off if I just gave it my cell number. I didn't have one. Little by little the world was indeed changing, with extra content on popular culture being offered exclusively on phones.\n\nI was an extremely 'interested' kid, but in the early 80s, there was almost no way to look things up. I had to go to the library, but it was across town. How often are you going to cross town to look up a bird you saw in your yard, or to get more information on a particular figure from history you saw on a TV documentary? My aged dictionary didn't even have a lot of the words I would look up, and forget anything really new, which I wouldn't even have heard, lacking the internet to make me aware of it.\n\nIt almost saddens me, despite that I am glad I had all that time in childhood to explore the woods, build things, play with my dogs, wrestle and race friends, and go swimming. There's so much I could have learned so much earlier. I like making things - all sorts of things, from Halloween costumes on my sewing machine and electronics stuff at my bench, to machined parts and woodworked items, but I didn't even know there was such a thing as a mini mill until Make Magazine came along - which I found out about online - and eventually held the first Maker Faire, which I attended in San Mateo, where I finally saw a mini mill. I've always wanted a mill, but they're huge, crazy heavy, and 10s of 1000s of dollars. I didn't know there were small, ~$1k versions for the 15 years I could have safely and intelligently operated one. I had so many little invention ideas I would have made.\n\nI feel as though I'm playing catch-up all the time now, reading voraciously every night through the online materials of my many hobbies. I finally got a cellphone, and it's been very nice, honestly. It's much more than just the portable phone I never wanted. It's connected me much more with people in ways I do like. I can snag a picture of something I'm working on in my woodshop and post it to Facebook immediately, and show projects as I make them. This has lead to probably 30 requests from friends to buy items in the last month or two.

{"archived":true,"author":"[deleted]","body":"First off, don't quote me while modifying what I wrote. That's pretty obnoxious.\n\nThe O'Caml code is also not equivalent; it works via side-effects. The Haskell version initializes a new random number generator and creates a random number in isolation. Repeated evaluations will give you the same result.\n\nIf you don't care about that, Haskell can be shorter still:\n\n    replicateM 10 randomIO\n\nKeep in mind that, again, the Haskell version is generic and the O'Caml version is not. You only need the signature if you're writing generic code that's not even possible in O'Caml. If the type is locally known, you don't need it. For example, no signature needed:\n\n    replicateM 10 randomIO &gt;&gt;= return . map (+ 1.0)\n\nRegardless, the Random stuff is probably a worst-case for Haskell 98, and the end result is still comparable if not shorter than O'Caml while offering greater generic capability. I may've overstated things slightly before but I still don't see this as any sort of major issue worth complaining about.\n\n&gt; Ok, so you have to remove all overloading and specialize the monads.\n\nThey're specialized automatically when you're doing IO. Random number generation is a rather special case in Haskell due to the interface provided in Haskell 98. You don't run into the same issues with IO. For example:\n\n    main = do\n      name &lt;- getLine\n      putStrLn (\"Hello, \" ++ name ++ \"!\")\n\n&gt; Your F# code is wrong\n\nQuite a lousy error message then. In Haskell, I'd at least be able to see the constraint that was ambiguous so I'd know I was on the wrong track. Of course, F# inherits that brain-dead approach to overloading from C#.\n\nIf you want a different example, F# can't handle this basic expression:\n\n    &gt; List.map id\n    error FS0030: Value restriction. The value 'it' has been inferred to have \n    generic type\n    val it : ('_a list -&gt; '_a list)    \n    Either make the arguments to 'it' explicit or, if you do not intend for it to\n    be generic, add a type annotation.\n\nThis has all gone on way too long.

{"archived":true,"author":"scubaguy","body":"A good interview from a couple of experts on Scala. There are some good bits to take away:\n\n* David argues the logic \"Scala is a superior computer language to Java and programs written in Scala are superior ... than those written in Java\" is flawed if you are considering using Scala in a large organization. His focus has been on the point \"the cost of institutional change to Scala is very high\". He asserts ignoring the cost and focusing on the benefit is a logical flaw.\n\n* To be concise, the biggest hurdle a Java developer has to overcome learning Scala is not falling back on their Java mutable ways. But there are plenty of other hurdles (the type system, the documentation, lack of well defined patterns, etc.)\n* [Scala developers] won't be cheap (average cost $250/hr plus whatever markup I add.) They won't be local. But they will be excellent.\n\n* I think Scala is technically superior to Java, but it's not superior enough to overcome the predictability of using a known solution\n\n* If it makes you feel better to think, \"I like Scala so I must be in the top 5% of developer\" knock yourself out, but I would advise against believing your own press on that one. I have a bigger problem with people deciding that others are not smart enough to learn a particular language.\n\n\n* I think that there are people in the Scala community that do groove on intellectual bullying. But that's a significant minority, although they are pretty vocal.\n* A shoutout to GridGain.\n\n* one great way to try out Scala with a minimum of risk is to use it to write your tests for an existing Java project. Testing code doesn't go out to production, and libraries like ScalaTest, ScalaCheck and Borachio can greatly increase your productivity when writing tests.\n\n* Groovy is the worst of all possible worlds. It exists because JRuby wasn't quite up to snuff when Groovy was born. But Groovy is ugly (like Java), has inconsistent syntax, has weak meta-programming, weak performance, junk for a type system, etc. ... I think that Groovy is in the space of, \"Well... there's nothing better. It's not something to get excited about, but it's better than nothing.\" Kind of like plastic garbage cans. They dent less than metal ones and have very little else to get excited about.\n\n* learning Scala will familiarize you with the features you will probably see in other modern statically typed languages that will be released in the next few years, so what have you got to lose?\n\n* Will Scala be the next Java? Unlikely, but it seems like it has a shot at being a tier one language like Ruby or Python. It just may take fifteen years. Scala, with its strongly typed, modern programming language features, and few legacy warts, is perhaps inspiring a bumper crop of new competitors (eg Ceylon, and Kotlin) and some retooling of olds ones (Groovy++ and Gosu) \n","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1317822343","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"c2p1sh0","link_id":"t3_l0qei","name":"t1_c2p1sh0","parent_id":"t3_l0qei","retrieved_on":1427689644,"score":7,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"scala","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh37","ups":7,"year":2011,"month":10}

{"archived":true,"author":"Myeir","body":"Not a problem. I remember being in the same place as you a few years back. Starting out everything can seem overwhelming. The type of software you use is really a matter of taste and the purpose you want it to serve. I personally use the Legacy family tree software (similar to rootmagic) but I like to keep all of my files/resources/pictures/documents in digital storage. Some people prefer to use hard copies/binders/filing cabinets. If you are one of those people geni.com will work perfectly fine as a reference tree. Something you can look at to remember what great-great grandma's father was named.  \n\nSince you don't have any living relatives or heirlooms another piece of advice I would give you is to start making these memories for future generations. I went out and bought a journal, googled \"genealogy interview questions\" and started answering those questions about myself. You should get your siblings to do the same. Who knows, maybe a great-great grand niece will stumble upon it someday and be so excited to have a real journal written by her ancestor. \n\nAlso, since you don't have living relatives to fill in some of the stories that make a family history come alive, you should really focus in on newspapers and other documents that might give you a glimpse into what life for your ancestors may have been like. I know I mentioned that before, but in your case I think it would be even more crucial. Search for the genweb associated with the state your ancestors came from (I'm assuming your in the US. Ignore this if I'm wrong) They often have links to online transcriptions of census records, newspaper articles, obituaries, etc. and they are free.

Since he was born in a time when such a thing was shameful, it's really hard to find information about him. There was a mention of him in the newspaper when he was a baby, but then he never got mentioned in any other newspaper articles about my great-grandparents after that (so I'm guessing he was diagnosed pretty young). I don't know the reason for his institution, although my mom remembers hearing something about a forceps delivery that might have caused brain damage.\n\nI found a census record from 1930 with him in the institution, but either the institution name was wrong or they just put a generic name on the census record, because I can't find it that way. The next mention I can find of him is a death record from the 1980s.\n\nI'd love to find out more about this relative. My heart breaks at the thought of his isolation and basically exile from the family (so few people know about him--in fact, my grandmother had no idea until she married my grandfather and someone let it slip).\n\nIf anyone has ideas about how to research institutions, I'd really appreciate it.

{"archived":true,"author":"rnelsonee","body":"&gt;What is the reason banks use what seems like the least secure password policies of all websites?\n\n\nSupport of legacy systems -- namely phone systems -- is the main reason. Banks and other big institutions were the first to get on the whole customer account access train and that first-adopter status is now hurting them because it's too expensive to overhaul their systems. \n\nWhen these systems went up, they had users log in with the medium at the time, which was over touch-tone phones, which was limited of course to alphanumerics. I remember when phones didn't even have a \"Q\" or \"Z\" on them, but that had to change when you could start looking up things like stock symbols, which were created without regard to phone-keypad-letter availability. And this was before the internet, so passwords over 6 or 8 characters didn't seem necessary.\n\nI noticed this after Fidelity made me use no special characters in my password. I realized why when I went to call them about a question... and had to key in my password. If my password had special characters in it, I wouldn't have known what number to press.\n\nLooking at all of my accounts online, the four that don't allow special characters all have phone support (financial institutions and a utility company). But since a place like Dropbox or Gmail won't ever have you call them and manage your account over the phone, they can have strong passwords.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1319806821","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"c2v5khy","link_id":"t3_lrf3l","name":"t1_c2v5khy","parent_id":"t1_c2v3mbg","retrieved_on":1427795247,"score":8,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"xkcd","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh0z","ups":8,"year":2011,"month":10}

There's no way around it, no guarantee that the author of function made sure the null will not pass through.\n\nSecond, you are not going to use ONLY standard Scala library. That will make scala itself pretty useless. The power of any language is in the ecosystem of thrid-party libraries available to its users.\n\nAnd that's another huge field that is completely out of your control.\n\nAnd finally look at the return types AND the argument types of most scala functions. They are not of type Option. So that means authors of those functions MUST check their arguments for null. Are you sure that even half of them follow that rule ? Do you have ANY guarantees of the sort ?\n\nBtw i tried a small tutorial in scala code and it was very easy to introduce a null pointer exception. \n\n&gt;Linguistic enforcement is not necessary; \n\nI think i heard this argument before.

{"archived":true,"author":"gereedy","body":"I pretty much agree with you on all these points. I think most programmers think one character = one glyph on the screen. Making characters 32-bit doesn't solve this but at least you can't corrupt a string any more by breaking a pair or something like that.\n\nOn the other hand I think that String as a sequence of code points is correct because at some times and for some applications this is exactly what is needed. I do agree that often this is the wrong level of abstraction for many applications. The most basic problem I think of is that conversion between upper and lower case cannot be done at the code-point level. It would be great to have some higher level abstraction for text but I'm not sure what that should look like.\n\nFor what it's worth I'm using ICU behind the scenes for strings in Scala+LLVM so it could be possible to build a good abstraction on top of that.","controversiality":0,"created_utc":"1307202088","downs":0,"edited":"false","gilded":0,"id":"c1xqvmg","link_id":"t3_hqobc","name":"t1_c1xqvmg","parent_id":"t1_c1xqfxb","retrieved_on":1427211766,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"subreddit":"scala","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh37","ups":1,"year":2011,"month":6}
